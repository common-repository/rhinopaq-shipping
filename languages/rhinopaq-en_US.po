msgstr "<i>The WooCommerce plugin rhinopaq Shipping does not send any personal data from your site to us. If you use the smart rhinopaq function, the <b>dimensions</b> and <b>weight</b> of all items in the shopping cart are sent to our service or our servers. The data is used to inquire about the possible use of one of our rhinopaqs during checkout. If our service confirms the possibility, corresponding positive feedback is sent back to your store. rhinopaq is then suggested as a shipping method and a popup is opened, asking the user whether they want to use a reusable packaging or stay with a disposable solution. <br>The data is stored by us to be able to determine the quality of our calculations in the long term and to optimize the service. In addition to the product data, the <b>frequency of display</b> of the popup and the <b>decision</b> of the user are sent to us for statistical evaluations.<br> If you enter the <b>rhinopaq ID</b> in the admin area of your order, it will be sent to us along with the <b>order number</b> upon completion of the order. We can provide you with this data so that you can track which orders the reusable packaging was returned to us.</i>"
